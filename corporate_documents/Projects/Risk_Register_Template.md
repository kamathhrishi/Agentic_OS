## Risk Management Process
This register tracks identified risks, their assessment, and mitigation strategies.

## Risk Register

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Category | Impact | Probability | Risk Score | Owner | Mitigation Strategy | Status | Date Updated |
|---------|------------------|----------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|---------------------|--------|--------------|
| R001 | [Description] | [Technical/Business/Schedule/Resource] | [High/Med/Low] | [High/Med/Low] | [Score] | [Name] | [Strategy] | [Open/Mitigated/Closed] | [Date] |

## Risk Scoring Matrix

### Impact
- **High:** Major impact on project objectives
- **Medium:** Moderate impact on project objectives
- **Low:** Minor impact on project objectives

### Probability
- **High:** >70% chance of occurring
- **Medium:** 30-70% chance of occurring
- **Low:** <30% chance of occurring

### Risk Score Calculation
Risk Score = Impact × Probability
- High Impact × High Probability = Critical (9)
- High Impact × Medium Probability = High (6)
- Medium Impact × High Probability = High (6)
- Medium Impact × Medium Probability = Medium (4)
- Low Impact × Any = Low (1-3)

## Risk Categories

### Technical Risks
- Technology complexity
- Integration challenges
- Performance issues
- Security vulnerabilities

### Business Risks
- Scope changes
- Stakeholder alignment
- Market changes
- Budget constraints

### Schedule Risks
- Resource availability
- Timeline delays
- Dependencies
- External factors

### Resource Risks
- Key personnel availability
- Skill gaps
- Team changes
- Vendor issues

## Mitigation Strategies

### Avoid
- Eliminate the risk by changing approach

### Mitigate
- Reduce probability or impact

### Transfer
- Transfer risk to third party (insurance, contract)

### Accept
- Accept the risk and monitor

## Risk Review Process
- **Frequency:** Weekly during active phase, monthly during planning
- **Review Team:** Project Manager, Team Leads, Stakeholders
- **Escalation:** Risks scoring 7+ require executive review

## Risk Response Actions
For each active risk, document:
1. Response strategy selected
2. Action plan
3. Responsible party
4. Timeline
5. Success criteria
